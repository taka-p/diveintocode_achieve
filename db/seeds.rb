# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# require "csv"
#
# CSV.foreach('db/user.csv') do |row|
#   User.create(id:       row[0],
#               name:     row[1],
#               email:    row[2],
#               profile:  row[3],
#               password: row[4],
#               created_at: Time.now,
#               updated_at: Time.now
